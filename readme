YouTube Video Fetcher
Streamline is a complete full-stack application that continuously fetches the latest YouTube videos based on a predefined search query, stores them, and displays them on a clean, responsive, and searchable frontend.

A preview of the Streamline frontend, displaying a grid of the latest videos.

----> Key Features
Backend
--> Continuous Background Fetching: A dedicated worker service polls the YouTube Data API every 10 seconds for new videos.

--> API Key Rotation: Automatically cycles through multiple API keys to manage and mitigate quota exhaustion.

--> Scalable Architecture: Built with a microservice-like architecture using Docker, separating the API, background worker, database, and caching layer.

--> Advanced Full-Text Search: The API provides a powerful search endpoint that finds partial and out-of-order matches in video titles and descriptions.

--> Paginated API: The main video listing endpoint is paginated to efficiently handle large datasets.

Frontend
--> Real-time Search: A dynamic search bar that provides instant results as you type.

--> Fully Responsive: The user interface is built with Tailwind CSS and looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

--> Easy Pagination: Simple "Next" and "Previous" buttons for navigating through the video history.

--> Modern UI/UX: Clean, modern design with clear loading and empty states for a smooth user experience.

--> Zero-Setup Frontend: A single HTML file with React and Babel loaded via CDN means no build tools or npm install are needed to run the frontend.

---> Tech Stack & Architecture
This project is composed of several services that work together, all managed by Docker.

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Frontend: React (via CDN), Tailwind CSS

Database: PostgreSQL (for relational data storage and advanced full-text search)

Job Queue/Broker: BullMQ with Redis (for managing background tasks)

Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose

System Architecture
The system is designed for scalability and separation of concerns.

The Frontend (React) communicates with the Backend API (Express).

The Backend API schedules a recurring job in the Job Queue (Redis via BullMQ).

The Worker process picks up jobs from the queue, calls the YouTube API, and stores the video data in the Database (PostgreSQL).

The Backend API reads from the database to serve data to the frontend.

---> Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the entire project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose must be installed on your system.

Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>

Create and Configure Environment File
Copy the example environment file and fill in your details.

cp .env.example .env

You must open the .env file and add your YouTube Data API v3 keys:

YOUTUBE_API_KEYS=your_first_api_key,your_second_api_key

Build and Run the Containers
This single command will build the Node.js image and start all services (API, worker, database, Redis) in the background.

docker-compose up --build -d

Run the Database Migration
With the containers running, execute this command to set up the database schema.

docker-compose exec app npx sequelize-cli db:migrate --env production

Note: We specify the production environment to ensure it connects to the db container correctly.

Access the Application

Backend API: The API is now running at http://localhost:8000.

Frontend: Open the index.html file (located in the frontend folder) directly in your web browser.

The background worker will now be fetching videos every 10 seconds. It may take a minute for the first batch of videos to appear on the frontend.

---> API Endpoints
The backend provides the following RESTful API endpoints.

1. List Videos
Returns a paginated list of all stored videos, sorted by publishing date (newest first).

URL: /api/videos

Method: GET

Query Params:

page (number, optional, default: 1)

limit (number, optional, default: 10)

Example: http://localhost:8000/api/videos?page=2&limit=12

2. Search Videos
Performs a full-text search on video titles and descriptions.

URL: /api/videos/search

Method: GET

Query Parameter:

q (string, required)

Example: http://localhost:8000/api/videos/search?q=goal+highlights
